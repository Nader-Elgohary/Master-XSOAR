This\nincludes the domains and IPs contacted, the resources (JavaScript, CSS, etc)\nrequested from those domains, as well as additional information about the page\nitself. urlscan.io will take a screenshot of the page, record the DOM content,\nJavaScript global variables, cookies created by the page, and a myriad of other\nobservations. If the site is targeting the users one of the more than 600\nbrands tracked by urlscan.io, it will be highlighted as potentially malicious\nin the scan results.\n\nurlscan.io itself is a free service, but we also offer commercial products for\nheavy users and organisations that need additional insight.\n\nTo use the urlscan.io integration, sign up for a free user account and create\nan API key first: https://urlscan.io/user/signup\n\nThe urlscan.io content pack includes commands for:\n\n* Submitting URLs for scanning with different levels of visibility.\n* Using the urlscan.io Search API to find scans on the platform by a variety of indicators.\n* Retrieves the HTTP transactions made for a given URL using the URLScan integration.\n",
